        <h1>Chicken</h1>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 whole chicken (about 1kg/2lb 3oz), spatchcocked
                salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>6-12 fresh red chillies</li>
            <li>1 tbsp roughly chopped garlic</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt flakes</li>
            <li>½ tsp oregano</li>
            <li>½ tbsp paprika</li>
            <li>100ml/3½fl oz olive oil</li>
            <li>50ml/1¾fl oz red wine vinegar</li>
            <li>chips</li>
            <li>salad</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Method:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To make the piri-piri sauce, preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Place the chillies on a roasting tray and roast them for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cool and roughly chop the chillies. Place the chillies, garlic, salt, oregano, paprika, olive oil and vinegar in a saucepan, and simmer for 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Allow the mixture to cool, then blend it to a purée in a jug blender or food processor. Store in a lidded container at room temperature; it will keep for about a month. Shake before using.</li>
            <li>Place the spatchcocked chicken in a sealable plastic bag. Add half the piri-piri sauce, spreading it evenly over the chicken. Seal and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 200C/390F/Gas 6, and preheat a large griddle pan on the hob. Alternatively, light your barbecue.</li>
            <li>Season the marinated chicken, and cook it on the griddle pan for 2-3 minutes on each side, until golden brown. Transfer the griddled chicken to a roasting tray and roast in the oven for 30 minutes, until cooked through. Alternatively, place the chicken on a medium heat barbecue, covered, for 10-15 minutes on both sides or until cooked through, basting regularly with the remaining piri-piri sauce.</li>
            <li>Serve straight away with chips and a salad.</li>
        </ol>
